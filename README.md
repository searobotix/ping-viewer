Graphical user interface for the Blue Robotics Ping echosounder. Ping is a simple, affordable, and compact rangefinder
for any aquatic project. Ping is [available here][4]!

The primary goal of _Ping Viewer_ is to be easy to use for both first time and advanced users. It provides full access to the sensor configuration, setup and visualization via [ping-protocol][1].

All of the code is open-source, so you can modify it and contribute. Follow [Blue Robotics software guidelines][3] for more information.
